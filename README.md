### Overview
This project is a personal website presented as an interactive system rather than a conventional portfolio.

The website functions both as a space for exploration and as a gateway to my actual projects.




### Technical Notes
- Built with HTML, CSS, and javascript
- Designed for GitHub Pages deployment
- Code structure prioritizes long-term maintainability and extensibility
- Sound is used as systemic feedback, not as background decoration
